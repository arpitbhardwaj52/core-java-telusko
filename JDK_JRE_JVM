🟢 JVM is the heart of Java.

It is responsible for running Java programs by converting bytecode into machine code for execution.

🔹 Key Responsibilities:

        Converts .class (bytecode) files into machine code.

        Manages memory allocation (Heap, Stack).

        Handles Garbage Collection (GC).

        Enables platform independence (Write Once, Run Anywhere).

🟠 JRE is JVM + Java libraries

It provides everything needed to run Java programs but not to develop them.

🔹 JRE Includes:

        JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

        Core Libraries (Java API, rt.jar, etc.)

        Runtime Tools (like Java class loader)

🔹 JRE Alone ≠ Java Development Environment

        You cannot compile Java code with just JRE.

        It only allows execution of Java applications.

🔴 JDK = JRE + Development Tools

JDK contains everything needed to develop and run Java applications.

🔹 JDK Includes:

JRE (which includes JVM and libraries)

        Java Compiler (javac)

        Debugging Tools (jdb)

        JavaDoc (javadoc)

        Other utilities (jar, jlink, etc.)

🔹 JDK is Required for Developers

        If you want to write, compile, and run Java code, you need JDK.
