/*
 * This class will help in understanding Inner Class, Anonymous Inner class and their usage.
 * An Inner class is a class that is defined inside another class.It allows for logical grouping of classes that are used in one place, increases encapsulation, and can lead to more readable and maintainable code.
 * Inner classes can access members of the outer class, including private members.
 * 
 * In Java, you cannot call a method of the outer class using an inner class object in the format: innerObject.outerMethod(); // ‚ùå Not allowed
 * 
 * Always use OuterClassName.this.OuterClassMethodOrVariable for removing ambiguity anyways it's optional.
 * 
 * Anonymous Inner Class is the class that has no defination inside the Outer Class and the defination is given while object instantiation.
 * 
 * Anonymous Inner Class are great usage when implementing interface or an abstract class just once.
